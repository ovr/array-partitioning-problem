Array Partitioning Problem
==========================

Split an array of numbers into a specified number of arrays so that the sum of all elements in each array 
would be as equal as possible. 
 
e.g. You have these numbers:

1,2,4,7,1,6,2,8

Lets split them into 3 groups:

8,2    = 10

7,2,1  = 10

6,4,1  = 11
